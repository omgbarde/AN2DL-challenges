# AN2DL Challenges using Deep Learning

This project involves **deep learning techniques** for two distinct classification challenges: pain detection from skeletal motion data and medical image classification.

## 📌 Project Objectives

### Challenge 1: Pirate Pain Detection
Classify pain levels based on skeletal joint motion sequences using hierarchical classification:
- Processing multivariate time-series data from skeletal joints
- Implementing multi-stage classification (no pain vs. low pain vs. high pain)
- Training multiple neural network architectures (MLP, CNN, ensemble methods)

### Challenge 2: Medical Image Classification
Classify medical images using transfer learning and ensemble methods:
- Preprocessing and augmenting medical image datasets
- Fine-tuning pre-trained models (EfficientNetB0, Phikon)
- Building ensemble models for improved accuracy

## 📁 Repository Structure
- **challenge1/** - Pain detection implementation (the_normie, the_layered_pain, jury_of_five notebooks)
- **challenge2/** - Medical image classification (EfficientNetB0, Phikon, ensemble notebooks)
- **requirements.txt** - Required Python packages
